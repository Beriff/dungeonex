DungeonEx is a discord bot that adds turn-based RPG to your server. Each game is personalized: one person controls his own game, nobody can interfere him. Each new game is unique:
every dungeon, every item, every monster, every item -- everything is randomly generated, and that guarantees a totally new and fresh experience every time.

The bot got console logging so if you are running the bot on your machine you can see exactly what is happening even when you are not on the server. The code is mostly commeneted, with
every function having its own docstring. The whole structure is modular and can be easily extended for your needs.
